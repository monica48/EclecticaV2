# Interaction Layer 

This repo includes the code for the interaction layer. All the interactions are handled via websockets

# How to Run 
```
npm install 
npm start 
```

This will start the websocket server which the unity build depends on , you can now replace the websocket
url in the ArtGallery Metaverse [Here](../ArtGallery%20Metaverse)
 
# Warning 

We decided to use older version of socket.io  as there are various libararies available for unity that supports it
