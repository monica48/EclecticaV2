## A Guide to Deploying your Metaverse

**Deploying your own gallery**

We think it's best to watch this tutorial to deploy : https://youtu.be/7KYBc_6xhME?t=232
but for nerds here is the guide !

- Add metis testnet to you metamask via : https://docs.metis.io/building-on-metis/metamask-setting
- Fund your metis account with some tokens by following this manual : https://docs.metis.io/building-on-metis/getting-test-tokens
- Now you are set to deploy your own gallery , visit the following link : https://eclectica.4everland.app/
- Fill up all the details and select IPFS as mode of deployment , you will need to run your own ipfs node or use services such as infura to deploy 
(We assume that you are running your own ipfs node , steps : https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/)
- Now you will need to put in your ipfs api address , which is usually : "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001" 
 (for those who likes tweaking it's in status->advance->Api
- Now click on deploy and it will start deploying , you will need to sign a transaction to deploy your smart-contract for lazy-minting other than that sit back and relax
- You will receive an ipfs link which you can share after the uploading is done (don't forget to pin your upload)
